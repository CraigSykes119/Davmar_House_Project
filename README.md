![favicon for the website](read-me/media/web-favicon.png)

### Navigation Bar

- The website's navigation bar is responsive, featuring a logo on the left and three anchor elements on the right. These anchors provide quick access to different pages on the website, such as the home page, the gallery page, and the contact me page. The navigation elements remain consistent across all pages, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- The user can easily identify where they are on the site by a line underneath the active page on the navigation bar.
  
![active page on the website](read-me/media/active-page.png)

![cursor interacting with navigation menu](read-me/media/nav-hover.png)

- On devices with a screen size of less than 768px, most commonly on screens smaller than a tablet, the navigation menu responds by using the burger icon to save space and keep the integrity of the web design. This was created following the steps in the love running project.

![burger menu on smaller screens](read-me/media/nav-burger.png)

- When the burger menu is clicked, it expands underneath the logo, then dissapears again after an option is clicked.

![burger menu open on smaller screens](read-me/media/burger-open.png)

### Footer

- This is accompanied by cover text with a semi transparent background in the the top center of the hero image. The cover text consists of a qoute by Alfred Austin speaking of the joy of working in the garden. This qoute was sourced from [BrainyQoutes.com](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/alfred_austin_169801).

The image shows a garden in full bloom, aiming to create a visual of what a garden could could look like. The image of the garden is from canva stock photos.

- The responsivness of this section follows a similar pattern to that of Meet Craig, however on larger screen, the order is reversed where the image is first and text second.

#### Benefits of Gardening

- The benefits of gardening section consists of text and a video from YouTube. The text portrays that Craig was involved in a project that aimed at promoting mental health through gardening, and the video acts as social proof to the benefits of such a project.

- The video offers the user full control with the ability to play, stop and all other controls associated with youTube videos. The link to the video on YouTube can be found [here](https://youtu.be/xC1hmFqC6e0?si=3zIAxWMuRDx2YRbI).

  - The gardening knowledge is expressed through a slider in order to allow the user to not have to put too much thought and worry they may over exagerate their knowledge. The user can move the slider based on their own judgement between one and ten.

![Garden slider in contact me form](read-me/media/contact-page/contact-me-slider.png)

- A FAQ page could be implemented in order to readily address beginner gardener's common questions.

### Bugs

#### Bug - logo Alignment

Couldn't get the logo to align in the centre with the navigation menu

![Logo alignment bug](read-me/bugs/logo-alignment-bug.png)

#### Solution

It seemed that aligning the logo to the baseline didn't effect it, but did alter the nev-menu, this seemed to be the cause of the issue. I removed the flex property used a fixed height and margin-bottom. This seemedto fix the issue.

#### Bug - Hover in Navigation Menu

Could not acheive the hover effect in the navigation menu

#### Solution

The px values and solid values were not entered, just the colour. This caused the hover effect to be invisible. Once those values were added, the effect performed as expected.

#### Bug - Cover Text Alignment

Struggled to get the cover text on the hero image to sit top-center across all devices.

![cover text bug](read-me/bugs/cover-text-bug.png)

#### Solution

Instead of using a fixed px value, or using flex, I changed the css to left 50% and set top to 7%. The important addtion to this was “transform: translateX(-50%);”, which accounted for the size of the div.

#### Bug - Contact me Background Image

Background image would not cover the entire page on the contact me page, it was consistantly leaving white space at the bottom despite css rules.

![contact me background bug](read-me/bugs/contactbg-bug.png)

#### Solution

After availing of the tutor service and speaking with other students on slack "RaneemYad_5P", I moved the id "contact-bg" from a div I had within the main element and attached it to the main element itself. I then removed the absolute positioning within that ID.
