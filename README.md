### Bugs

#### Bug - logo Alignment

Couldn't get the logo to align in the centre with the navigation menu

![Logo alignment bug](read-me/bugs/logo-alignment-bug.png)

#### Solution

It seemed that aligning the logo to the baseline didn't effect it, but did alter the nev-menu, this seemed to be the cause of the issue. I removed the flex property used a fixed height and margin-bottom. This seemedto fix the issue.

#### Bug - Hover in Navigation Menu

Could not acheive the hover effect in the navigation menu

#### Solution

The px values and solid values were not entered, just the colour. This caused the hover effect to be invisible. Once those values were added, the effect performed as expected.

#### Bug - Cover Text Alignment

Struggled to get the cover text on the hero image to sit top-center across all devices.

![cover text bug](read-me/bugs/cover-text-bug.png)

#### Solution

Instead of using a fixed px value, or using flex, I changed the css to left 50% and set top to 7%. The important addtion to this was “transform: translateX(-50%);”, which accounted for the size of the div.

#### Bug - Contact me Background Image

Background image would not cover the entire page on the contact me page, it was consistantly leaving white space at the bottom despite css rules.

![contact me background bug](read-me/bugs/contactbg-bug.png)

#### Solution

After availing of the tutor service and speaking with other students on slack "RaneemYad_5P", I moved the id "contact-bg" from a div I had within the main element and attached it to the main element itself. I then removed the absolute positioning within that ID.
